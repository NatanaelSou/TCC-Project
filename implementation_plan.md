# Implementation Plan

Create a search results page that displays creators and contents filtered by keywords entered in the search bar, navigated to as a new page when the user performs a search.

The search functionality will allow users to find creators and content by matching keywords against creator names, categories, descriptions, and content titles/categories. The results page will show filtered lists of creators and contents in a layout similar to the explore page, with sections for creators and different content types.

[Types]
No new data types are required. Existing models (User, ProfileContent) will be used. A search query string will be passed to the results page.

[Files]
New files to be created:
- lib/screens/search_results_page.dart: New page widget that displays search results with filtered creators and contents.

Existing files to be modified:
- lib/screens/home_page.dart: Add TextEditingController and onSubmitted handler to the search TextField to navigate to search results page when user submits search.
- lib/widgets/creator_section.dart: Modify to accept an optional list of creators instead of filtering internally, to support passing pre-filtered results.
- lib/widgets/content_section.dart: Modify to accept an optional list of contents instead of using mock data directly.
- lib/services/api_service.dart: Add mock search methods for creators and contents.
- lib/mock_data.dart: Ensure mock data includes searchable fields.

[Functions]
New functions:
- ApiService.searchCreators(String query): Mock method to filter creators by query.
- ApiService.searchContents(String query): Mock method to filter contents by query.
- SearchResultsPage._filterCreators(String query): Filter creators list based on query.
- SearchResultsPage._filterContents(String query): Filter contents list based on query.

Modified functions:
- CreatorSection.build(): Accept optional creators list parameter.
- ContentSection.build(): Accept optional contents list parameter.

[Classes]
New classes:
- SearchResultsPage: StatefulWidget for displaying search results.

Modified classes:
- CreatorSection: Add optional creators parameter to constructor.
- ContentSection: Add optional contents parameter to constructor.

[Dependencies]
No new dependencies required. Existing http and provider packages are sufficient.

[Testing]
Unit tests for search filtering logic in ApiService.
Widget tests for SearchResultsPage to ensure correct display of filtered results.
Integration test for search flow from home page to results page.

[Implementation Order]
1. Modify CreatorSection and ContentSection to accept optional lists.
2. Add search methods to ApiService.
3. Create SearchResultsPage with filtering logic.
4. Update home_page.dart search bar to navigate to SearchResultsPage on submit.
5. Test the search functionality with various queries.
