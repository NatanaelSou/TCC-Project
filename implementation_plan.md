# Implementation Plan

Fix video player navigation and loading issues to prevent blank screens and lag when returning to home page.

The current implementation has issues with video loading failures leading to blank screens, and improper navigation causing state management problems that result in lag. The solution involves adding error handling for video initialization, changing navigation patterns, and ensuring proper resource cleanup.

[Types]
No new types are required for this implementation.

[Files]
- lib/screens/video_player_screen.dart: Modify to add error handling for video initialization, change pushReplacement to push for recommendations, and improve loading states.
- lib/widgets/content_section.dart: Update navigation to use push instead of pushReplacement for consistency.

[Functions]
- _initializeVideo: Add try-catch for initialization errors and set error state.
- _navigateToVideoPlayer: Change from pushReplacement to push in recommendations.

[Classes]
No new classes required.

[Dependencies]
No new dependencies needed.

[Testing]
- Test video loading with valid and invalid URLs.
- Test navigation between videos and back to home.
- Verify no lag after multiple video navigations.

[Implementation Order]
1. Update video_player_screen.dart to handle initialization errors.
2. Change navigation in video_player_screen.dart recommendations to use push.
3. Update content_section.dart navigation if needed.
4. Test the changes.
