# Implementation Plan

[Overview]  
The goal is to upgrade and modify the existing Flutter + Node.js + MySQL project to create a minimum viable product (MVP) that supports user registration, login, basic content publication, monthly subscriptions with tiers, and an initial community chat/mural, while keeping the frontend using mock data services for API interactions.

This implementation is needed to provide a functional baseline platform called Premiora, which unifies content creation, community interaction, and monetization in a single environment. The approach is to leverage the existing backend API for user management and authentication, while the frontend will continue using mock data for content and community features initially. This allows incremental development and testing of core features before full backend integration.

[Types]  
No major type system changes are required at this stage since the frontend uses Dart models for User and ProfileContent, and the backend uses JavaScript objects with MySQL schemas. The existing User model in Dart and the users table in MySQL are sufficient for MVP.

[Files]  
- New files:  
  - None required for MVP; focus is on modifying existing files.

- Existing files to be modified:  
  - Backend:  
    - `backend/controllers/userController.js` - Ensure user registration and listing endpoints are robust.  
    - `backend/controllers/loginController.js` - Handle user login.  
    - `backend/routes/userRoutes.js` and `backend/routes/loginRoutes.js` - Route setup for user and login APIs.  
    - `backend/services/userService.js` and `backend/services/loginService.js` - Business logic for user registration and login.  
  - Frontend:  
    - `lib/services/api_service.dart` - Currently mock, keep as is for MVP.  
    - `lib/services/auth_service.dart` - Mock authentication service, keep as is.  
    - `lib/screens/landing_page.dart` - UI for login and registration modals.  
    - `lib/screens/home_page.dart` - Main app page with navigation and content sections.  
    - `lib/screens/video_player_screen.dart` - Video player UI with YouTube/Patreon style layout.  
    - `lib/user_state.dart` - Global user state management.  
    - `lib/models/user.dart` - User data model.  
    - `lib/constants.dart` - UI constants for colors, dimensions, and strings.

- Files to be deleted or moved:  
  - None.

- Configuration file updates:  
  - None required for MVP.

[Functions]  
- New functions:  
  - None for MVP; focus on existing functions.

- Modified functions:  
  - Backend user registration and login functions to ensure proper validation and error handling.  
  - Frontend login and registration handlers in `landing_page.dart` to interact with mock services and update user state.

- Removed functions:  
  - None.

[Classes]  
- New classes:  
  - None.

- Modified classes:  
  - Frontend `AuthService` and `ApiService` remain mock but may be extended later.  
  - UI classes in `landing_page.dart`, `home_page.dart`, and `video_player_screen.dart` to support MVP features.

- Removed classes:  
  - None.

[Dependencies]  
- No new dependencies are required for MVP.  
- Backend uses express, mysql2, cors, dotenv.  
- Frontend uses flutter, provider, http, video_player, file_picker, image_picker.

[Testing]  
- Manual testing of user registration, login, navigation, and video player UI.  
- No automated tests currently; consider adding tests in future iterations.

[Implementation Order]  
1. Verify backend user registration and login endpoints are functional and robust.  
2. Ensure frontend login and registration modals in `landing_page.dart` correctly use mock `AuthService` and update `UserState`.  
3. Confirm main app navigation and content display in `home_page.dart` using mock data.  
4. Validate video player screen layout and controls in `video_player_screen.dart`.  
5. Perform manual testing of user flows: registration, login, navigation, video playback.  
6. Document any issues or enhancements for future backend integration and feature expansion.
