# Implementation Plan for Fixing RenderFlex Overflow Issues

## Information Gathered
- RenderFlex overflow issues are likely caused by Rows containing Text widgets without constraints.
- Key files involved:
  - lib/screens/video_player_screen.dart
  - lib/widgets/content_section.dart
  - lib/screens/profile_page.dart

## Plan
- lib/screens/video_player_screen.dart
  - Wrap views Text widget in `_buildVideoInfo` inside a `Flexible` widget.
  - Wrap the Row in `_buildActionButtons` inside a `SingleChildScrollView` with horizontal scroll.
  - Add `maxLines` and `overflow` properties to title Text widgets where missing.
- lib/widgets/content_section.dart
  - Wrap views Text widget in `_buildContentInfo` inside a `Flexible` widget.
  - Add `maxLines` and `overflow` properties to title Text widgets where missing.
- lib/screens/profile_page.dart
  - Change the Row in `_buildStatsSection` to a `Wrap` widget to allow wrapping on narrow screens.
  - Add `maxLines` and `overflow` properties to title Text widgets where missing.

## Dependent Files to be Edited
- lib/screens/video_player_screen.dart
- lib/widgets/content_section.dart
- lib/screens/profile_page.dart

## Followup Steps
- Test the app on different screen sizes to verify no RenderFlex overflow errors.
- Verify UI looks good and scrolls properly where needed.
